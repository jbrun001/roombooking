## Description
A room booking system with complex searching and enhanced security features.

## Features
- Complex search functionality.
- Room booking approval workflow.  
- Security testing with OWASP tools.

## Vulnerability testing
During this project I learnt to use OWASP Zap for automated application vulnerability testing, producing security reports for the team during the development process (https://github.com/jbrun001/roombooking/tree/main/security). The process of conducting these tests increased my security knowledge significantly and highlighted new areas of security to consider (CORS) as well as highlighting weaknesses in the existing protections that had been coded (SQL Injection) so they could be corrected by the team.

## Teamwork
This was the first project that I had worked on with a larger team of developers, and the first time using git collaboratively. There were 6 developers involved including myself. This required more co-ordination that I had been used to on previous projects. Github issues and using a github project were essential to keeping things on track. I learnt that the task distribution was critical, and the tasks for development needed to be ordered so they created opportunities for other team members to contribute in parallel (and in the future). This meant understanding the team skills, but also ensuring that there were a variety of backlog issues to be worked on.

I spent more time on documentation, and even did some video walkthroughs, in this project - this was to make sure that as individuals learnt new skills, the team was kept up to date and also learnt those skills. Otherwise the team members who could have contributed would have become smaller as the project progressed.

## Skills Developed
- **Node.js** - Backend API and logic.  
- **CORS** - Cross-origin security.  
- **SQL** - Complex queries.  
- **OWASP Zap** - Security vulnerability testing
- **Team Training** - [Training videos created for the team](https://github.com/jbrun001/roombooking/tree/main/dev-team-walkthroughs)
- **XSS and SQL Injection Defense** - Secure coding practices.
- **Wireframe design** - quick mock ups for feedback
- **Cloud Database use** - setup of cloud MySQL for ease of development team
- **Issue Management** - [implementation of github projects and issues](https://github.com/users/jbrun001/projects/1)
- **Deployment Troubleshooting** - resolving BCRYPT node package differences on production vs development
- **Project Managment** - allocation of tasks using kanban, and timeline management
